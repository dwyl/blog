# The dwyl blog

## Please review and contribute to an exciting new proposal for the dwyl blog (https://github.com/dwyl/blog/issues/27)

## Why
To build dwyl's reputation and showcase the awesome work we've done, both as an agency and as an exciting member of the wider tech and open-source community. To get the world to start talking about us (if they aren't already).

## What
A blog with a coherent identity and voice, which reflects dwyl and its values, which is consistently updated with quality content. More than just a company blog.

## How
View the current proposal at https://github.com/dwyl/blog/issues/27; add your thoughts.
